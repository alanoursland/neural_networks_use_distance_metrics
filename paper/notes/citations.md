### Redundant Citations Summary

* Several instances of redundant citations repeat historical context or overemphasize points already made. Removing these redundancies would streamline the section.

### Potential for rudin2019stop

*   **Possible placement:**  After the discussion of the prevailing focus on activation magnitude (around citation 15), you could add a sentence like, "However, this emphasis on interpreting individual activations as a proxy for feature importance may distract from exploring alternative, potentially more interpretable, representational frameworks within neural networks [cite: 39]." This would create a smoother transition to the discussion of distance-based methods.
