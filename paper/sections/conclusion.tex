\section{Conclusion}

This paper provides empirical validation for the theoretical connection between neural networks and Mahalanobis distance proposed in \cite{oursland2024interpreting}. Through systematic perturbation analysis, we have demonstrated that neural networks with different activation functions implement distinct forms of distance-based computation, offering new insights into their learning and decision-making processes.
